      br
      |  2. Information in forms.

        |  2.  The Website can also save information about connection settings (time, IP address)
        br
        |  3.  The data in the forms is not shared with third parties unless agreed upon with the user.
        br

        br

      br
      |  3. Information about cookie files.
      p
        br
        |  1.  The Website uses cookies.
        br
        |  2.  Cookie files (so-called "cookies") are computer data, mainly text files, that is stored in end-devices of the Website User and is intended for use with the pages of the Web Servbr
        |ice. Typically, cookies contain the name of a website from which they come, their storage time on end-devices and a unique number.
        br
        |  3.  The Website Operator places cookies in Website Users' end-devices and has direct access to them.
        br
        |  4.  Cookies are used for the following purposes:
        br

Session cookies are temporary files that are stored in the end-device of the User until logging-out, leaving the website or turning off the software (web browser). Persistent cookies are stored in the end-device of the User for a specified time that is determined in cookie parameters or until the User deletes them.
        br
        |  6.  Software for browsing websites (a browser) usually allows storing cookies on users' end-devices by default. Website Users can change these settings. The web browser allows deleting cookies. It is also possible to block cookies automatically. Details of how to do so can be found in the help section or the browser documentation.
        br
